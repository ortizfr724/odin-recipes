            As the days grow shorter and the air turns crisp, there's no better way to indulge in the flavors of the season than
            with a Pan Seared Duck Breast. This rich and savory dish, paired with creamy mashed potatoes and a sweet-tart red cherry 
            glaze, is the epitome of autumnal comfort food. To complement the robust flavors of the duck, a glass of full-bodied Shiraz 
            offers a perfect pairing, with its dark fruit notes and velvety tannins enhancing the overall dining experience.

                        skin-side down for 8-10 minutes or until the skin is crispy and the fat has rendered.

                    <li>Flip the duck breast over away from your body and cook for 3-4 minutes for medium to medium-well.</li>
